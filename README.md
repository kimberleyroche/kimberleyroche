### Hi there! 👋
My name is Kim. I was just a hobbyist who was vibing until I realised coding was pretty fun.

What am I doing?
- ☠ I’m currently working on a Halloween Recipe Book. 
- 📓 I’m currently learning CSS, JavaScript and Python.

Projects:
- 💗 Hello Kitty Bedtime: drag Kitty White and other Sanrio friends around the screen and tuck them into bed. Uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 👻 Halloween Recipe Book: simple recipes focused around our favourite spooky season. Uses HTML and CSS, an assignment done for The Odin Project's foundation course.
- 🦋 Butterfly Shrine Landing Page (tbd): an ode to butterflies. Uses HTML and CSS, the second assignment done for The Odin Project's foundation course.
- ☀️ Sunday Sites profile: will host all websites I make for Sunday Sites.
