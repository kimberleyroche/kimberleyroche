<h1> Hi there! 👋 </h1>

My name is Kim. I was a hobbyist just vibing, but then I realised coding was pretty fun.

### I am currently...
- 💀 Working on a Halloween Recipe Book. 
- 💻 Learning CSS, JavaScript and Python.
- 📚 Trying out LinkedIn Learning's free trial.
- 📝 Halfway through The Odin Project's foundation course, earning Google Skill Badges at Qwiklabs, and perusing through MIT's FreeCourseWare CS50 course. 

### Projects:
- 💗 Hello Kitty Bedtime: drag Kitty White and other Sanrio friends around the screen and tuck them into bed. Uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 👻 Halloween Recipe Book: simple recipes focused around our favourite spooky season. Uses HTML and CSS, an assignment done for The Odin Project's foundation course.
- 🦋 Butterfly Shrine Landing Page (tbd): an ode to butterflies. Uses HTML and CSS, the second assignment done for The Odin Project's foundation course.
- ☀️ Sunday Sites profile: will host all websites I make for Sunday Sites.
